## 🧬 Codename : *<Still Thinking...🤔>*

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology from Murshidabad College of Engineering and Technology, Berhampore (W.B.). I am from West Bengal — where the rice is hot and the code is hotter. My journey into the world of development started with curiosity and caffeine. Now? I turn ideas into Python scripts and bugs into GitHub commits.

> **Motto:** “Break things. Learn fast. Automate harder.”

## 🧪 Not Just Coding... Creating.

I don't build projects for the sake of it. I build **experiences**.  
Things that make people go:

> “Wait… you made *that* in Python?”

---

### ⚡ Fun Zone (Hidden Easter Egg)

> 🧩 Clone one of my projects.  
> 🛠️ Modify it.  
> 🔥 Break it.  
> 📦 Push it back with a twist.  
> 💬 Message me what you changed.  
> 🎁 I’ll feature your version here.

### 🧭 TL;DR – I’m not your average dev

If you’re looking for:
- A passionate, purpose-driven coder
- Someone who actually reads `README.md`s
- A dev who treats projects like storytelling

**Then you're already in the right repo.** ⭐ it now.
